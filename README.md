# guess_streetview

## üî• Updates
- **`version1.2`**: 
  - **Hard Mode**: In this mode, players are not allowed to move within the Street View environment. However, you still can zoom in and out or rotate.
  - **Extreme Mode**: This mode presents an additional challenge by only providing a single static image. You are required to determine the location based on just that one image.
- **`version1.1`**: support custom KML, the random point will appear in the region you create.

## üèÅ How to play
All you have to do is fill your own Google Map API key and enjoy the game!

Each play will cost you twice access time (each for Street View & select map).
